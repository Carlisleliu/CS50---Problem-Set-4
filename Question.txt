1. What’s stdint.h?
    The C99 standard includes definition of the following new integer types:
      - Exact-width integer types which are guaranteed to have the same number N of bits across all implementations.
      - Least-width integer types which are guaranteed to be the smallest type available in the implementation, that has at least 
      specified number N of bits. Guaranteed to be specified for at least N=8,16,32,64.
      - Fastest integer types which are guaranteed to be the fastest integer type available in the implementation, that has at least     
      specified number N of bits. Guaranteed to be specified for at least N=8,16,32,64.
      - Pointer integer types which are guaranteed to be able to hold a pointer. Included only if it is available in the implementation.
      - Maximum-width integer types which are guaranteed to be the largest integer type in the implementation.

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    uint8_t:   exact-width unsigned 8-bit integer ranging from 0 to 255;
    uint32_t:  exact-width unsigned 32-bit integer ranging from 0 to 2^32 - 1;
    int32_T:   exact-width signed 32-bit integer ranging from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1;
    uint16_t:  exact-width unsigned 16-bit integer ranging frm 0 to 2^16 - 1.

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    BYTE:   2 bytes;
    DWORD:  8 bytes;
    LONG:   8 bytes;
    WORD:   8 bytes.

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    hexadecimal. (Signature must be 4D42 hex)

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    The difference between bfSize and biSize = sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER) + sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER)
                                             = 40 + 14
                                             = 54
                                         
6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount.

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    Fopen may return NULL value when file is too large and there is not enough space or user does not authorized to create file.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    The third argument defines the number of elments. In our case, the STRUCT is only one element.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    biWidth is the width of the bitmap in pixels. If the width is 3, padding is necessary since the scanline must be a multiple of 4.
    3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixels gives 9 bytes, which needs 3 additional bytes of padding in order to get the scanline to 12, the next
    possible multiple of 4.

11. What does fseek do?
    fseek sets the file position of the stream to the given offset.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    The fseek function is used to change the file position of the stream stream. The value of whence must be one of the constants    
    SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, to indicate whether the offset is relative to the beginning of the file, the current file position, 
    or the end of the file, respectively.
